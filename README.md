# childcare_website
This is a project aimed at developing a childcare website with different levels of access using databases.

We are a team of 3 and each of us have a specific task or access level dedicated to them. 

This website consists of 3 access levels; a normal user, a parent user or an administrator role. 

#Normal role
The normal role is accessible to everyone (the public) entering the website without signing-in an account. 
#Parent role
The normal role is accessible to anyone that signed in a user account on the website. 
#Admin role
The admin role is only accessible to the developpers of the website (my teammates and me).

The website is developed using HTML/CSS, Bootstrap Libraries, MySQL, PHP and Javascript.
